  <section class="py-20 bg-white">

      <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold text-navy">Your safety program creates compliance. It doesn't create competence.</h2>
      <div class="mt-8 space-y-4 text-lg text-dark/80 leading-relaxed">
        <p>Your crew fills out JHAs because they have to. They sit through toolbox talks because it's on the schedule. They check the boxes on the observation card because someone's counting. And none of it changes how they actually see hazards when they're standing in front of the task.</p>
        <p>The problem isn't the people. It's that every tool in the safety industry — BBS programs, observation platforms, digital checklists — was designed to document compliance, not develop competence. They assume the worker already knows what to look for. Most of the time, that assumption is wrong.</p>
        <p>It's not that your program is bad. It's that the problem is deeper than any program can reach.</p>

      <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold text-navy">Hazard recognition isn't a checklist. It's a skill.</h2>
      <div class="mt-8 space-y-4 text-lg text-dark/80 leading-relaxed">
        <p>Experienced workers develop what the industry calls "the eye" — the ability to walk onto a site and immediately see what's off. It's not magic. It's pattern recognition built through years of exposure, near-misses, and mentoring from people who've been around long enough to know what matters.</p>
        <p>SafetyTAP accelerates that process. Like scaffolding on a building — you erect it to support the work, and you take it down when the structure can stand on its own.</p>

      <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold text-navy">Not another program. A practice.</h2>
      <div class="mt-8 space-y-4 text-lg text-dark/80 leading-relaxed">
        <p>Every safety technology on the market does one of two things: it automates compliance documentation, or it provides a digital checklist. SafetyTAP does neither.</p>
        <p>Observation platforms assume the worker already knows what to look for. Training platforms deliver content disconnected from the task. Wearables monitor the environment on the worker's behalf — zero cognitive development.</p>
        <p>SafetyTAP is the only tool that operates at the individual cognitive level, at the point of task, with zero friction. The output isn't a report or a compliance record. The output is a worker who's better at their job tomorrow than they were today.</p>

        <p>SafetyTAP gives you a leading indicator that actually leads. Not "observations completed," but actual cognitive development in the people doing the work.</p>
