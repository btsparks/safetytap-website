    <div class="mt-8 space-y-4 text-lg text-dark/80 leading-relaxed">
      <p>The construction industry has no shortage of safety tools. JHA, BBS, STOP, SLAM, STAR, TRACK, TARP, StartCard, LIF — the alphabet soup goes on. They all share the same fundamental limitation: they are top-down compliance systems that tell workers what to do rather than developing their capacity to see hazards for themselves.</p>
      <p>SafetyTAP is different. It's the first tool designed to operate at the individual cognitive level, at the point of task, with zero friction. A worker texts a photo of their current task. They get back a brief, specific observation that makes them see something they weren't seeing before. That's it.</p>
      <p>The output isn't a report or a compliance record. The output is a worker who's better at their job tomorrow than they were today.</p>

      <h2 class="font-display text-2xl md:text-3xl font-bold text-navy pt-6 tracking-tight">The Name</h2>
      <p>TAP stands for <strong>Think. Assess. Proceed.</strong> It's a practice, not a program. Three words that become a habit: pause, look, then go. Every interaction with SafetyTAP is one rep in building that habit.</p>

      <h2 class="font-display text-2xl md:text-3xl font-bold text-navy pt-6 tracking-tight">The Science</h2>
      <p>SafetyTAP's response framework is grounded in established psychological research — Bandura's self-efficacy theory, inattentional blindness, normalcy bias, the bystander effect, and the Dunning-Kruger effect. Every design decision, every word choice, every response pattern flows from this research.</p>
      <p>We don't identify hazards for people. We train people to identify hazards for themselves. The difference produces opposite long-term outcomes, and it's the reason SafetyTAP exists.</p>

      <h2 class="font-display text-2xl md:text-3xl font-bold text-navy pt-6 tracking-tight">FieldBridge AI</h2>
      <p>SafetyTAP is built by FieldBridge AI, a company focused on applying artificial intelligence to real problems in the construction industry. Not technology for technology's sake — practical tools that make field workers and safety professionals better at what they do.</p>
